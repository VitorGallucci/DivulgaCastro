// You don't strictly need JavaScript for the HITS counter badge to work,
// as it's just an image loaded from their server.

// However, you can add other interactive features here if needed.
console.log("Website script loaded.");

// Example: You could add event listeners or modify the DOM further.
// document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
//     console.log('DOM fully loaded and parsed');
//     // Add any JS-dependent initializations here
// });

// Note: Accessing the count value directly via JS from the HITS SVG
// is not straightforward or reliable across browsers. The visual display
// is the primary way HITS works.
